This tutorial is a brief introduction on how you can train a machine translation model (or any other seq2seq model) using PyTorch Ignite. This notebook uses Models, Dataset and Tokenizers from Huggingface, hence they can be easily replaced by other models from the ðŸ¤— Hub. Further, it allows you to train your Seq2seq models in a distributed manner across GPUs and on TPU.
